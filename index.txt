About me

Hello! I am Belhassen Khefacha, a passionate Computer Science Graduate Student currently pursuing my studies at the University of Michigan-Flint. My journey in technology is built on a solid academic foundation; I previously earned a Bachelor of Business Computing from the Higher School of Economic and Commercial Sciences in Tunisia. I am driven by a curiosity to understand how software works behind the scenes and a desire to build tools that solve real-world problems.

My technical experience covers a wide range of full-stack development skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Python, as well as frameworks like ReactJS and Symfony. I have applied these skills in practical settings, such as my internships at Dream Tek Consulting, where I built a vacation calendar and a hiking application featuring secure JWT authentication and third-party API integration. Currently, I am diving deeper into advanced technology through my research on enhancing GitHub Actions failure explanations using Large Language Models (LLMs).

Beyond the code, I pride myself on being a global citizen with a love for languages; I am proficient in English and Arabic, with working abilities in French and German. When I am not focused on programming or academic research, I enjoy unwinding through music and sports. I am always looking for the next opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute to impactful software projects.
